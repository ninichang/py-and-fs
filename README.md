## assignment 5: 

The game code that we developed in class can be found at: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user45_4MOO5vW6nR_4.py

In this assignment, you have to add 3 new features to the game:

1. Display the game score in the top-right corner of the game window. The score is the count  of the asteroids destroyed by the ship.
2. Have more than one asteroid on the screen at any one time. Instead of starting with a single asteroid, start with 3. Spawn a new asteroid every time one is destroyed.
3. Stop the game when an asteroid collides with the ship. By "stop the game", we mean that the animation freezes, and the text "Game Over" is printed at the center of the window. You do not need to close the game window as part of the operation. However, there should be no movement in the window, even when the game keys are pressed.
Submit your solution as a link to the code that you have developed.
